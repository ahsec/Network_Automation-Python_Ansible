# Class 2 Exercises.

#### * exercise_01_c1.py *
Write a simple Python module that contains one function that prints 'hello'
(module name = my_func.py). Do a test where you import my_func into a new
Python script. Test this using the following contexts:
#### * exercise_01_c2.py *
my_func.py is located in the same directory as your script
#### * exercise_01_c3.py *
my_func.py is located in some random subdirectory (not the same directory as
  your script)
#### * exercise_01_c4.py *
my_func.py is located in ~/applied_python/lib/python2.7/site-packages/


#### * exercise_02.py *
Write a script that connects using telnet to the pynet-rtr1 router. Execute the
 'show ip int brief' command on the router and return the output.

#### * exercise_03.py *
Using classes, repeat exercise 02

#### * exercise_03.py *
Using the *snmp_helper* library, create a script that connects to both routers
